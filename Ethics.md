OThe study is approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences of Utrecht University. The approval is based on the documents sent by the researchers as requested in the form of the Ethics committee and filed under number 23-1850. The approval is valid through 01 March 2024. The approval of the Ethical Review Board concerns ethical aspects, as well as data management and privacy issues (including the GDPR). Empirical data from the LISS panel was used. A detailed information on the ethical requirements in the LISS panel is provided below:

# LISS Panel Ethics

The LISS (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences) panel data adheres to stringent ethical requirements to ensure privacy, informed consent, and data security.  Hereâ€™s a detailed description of how it complies with these ethical standards:


Participant Information: Participants are thoroughly informed about the purpose of the study, the nature of the data being collected, the duration of their participation, and how the data will be used.

Voluntary Participation: Participation in the LISS panel is entirely voluntary. Participants can choose to withdraw at any time without any consequences.

Consent Forms: Written consent is obtained from all participants. These consent forms are comprehensive and include details about the study, confidentiality measures, and participants' rights.

Anonymization: Before the data is made available for research purposes, personally identifiable information (PII) is removed. This includes names, addresses, and any other information that could be used to identify an individual.

Pseudonymization: In some cases, data may be pseudonymized, where identifiers are replaced with pseudonyms or codes. This ensures that the data can still be linked back to the individual if necessary (e.g., for longitudinal studies) but cannot be directly traced without additional information that is kept securely.

Access Control: Access to sensitive data is strictly controlled. Only authorized personnel have access to raw data, and they are bound by confidentiality agreements.

Data Encryption: Sensitive data is encrypted during storage and transmission. This ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed without authorization, it cannot be read or misused.

Secure Storage: Data is stored in secure servers with robust security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits.

Relevance and Necessity: Only data that is necessary for the research objectives is collected and retained. This minimizes the risk associated with data breaches and ensures compliance with data protection principles.

Retention Policies: Data is kept only for as long as necessary to fulfill the research objectives. After this period, data is securely deleted or further anonymized.

# Ethical Review and Compliance

The LISS panel data collection and management processes are regularly reviewed by ethical review boards. These boards ensure that all ethical guidelines and legal requirements are met. The processes are subject to regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance with ethical standards and data protection laws.

The LISS panel data complies with ethical requirements through a comprehensive approach to privacy, informed consent, and data security. By ensuring informed consent, employing robust anonymization and pseudonymization techniques, and implementing stringent data security measures, the LISS panel maintains the highest ethical standards in its data collection and management practices. Regular ethical reviews and audits further ensure that these practices remain in compliance with current legal and ethical guidelines, thereby protecting the rights and privacy of participants while enabling valuable social science research.

# Participant Rights

Right to Access: Participants have the right to access their data and understand how it is being used.

Right to Rectification: Participants can request corrections to any inaccuracies in their data.

Right to Erasure: Participants can request the deletion of their data if they withdraw from the study or if the data is no longer necessary for the research objectives.
